## Tkinter Framework

CustomTkinter is a python UI-library based on Tkinter, which provides new, modern and
fully customizable widgets. They are created and used like normal Tkinter widgets and
can also be used in combination with normal Tkinter elements. The widgets
and the window colors either adapt to the system appearance or the manually set mode
('light', 'dark'), and all CustomTkinter widgets and windows support HighDPI scaling
(Windows, macOS). With CustomTkinter you'll get a consistent and modern look across all
desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).


## Installation

Install the module with pip:
```
pip3 install customtkinter

**Update existing installation:** ```pip3 install customtkinter --upgrade```\
